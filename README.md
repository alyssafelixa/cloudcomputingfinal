Description of Final Project: Community Amenities in Philadelphia

This project analyzes access to community amenities in Philadelphia using OpenStreetMaps data found in BigQuery, with visualizations in Carto. More specifically, these amenities include libraries, community centers and places of worship, all easily accessible to community members to foster strong community and sense of belonging. In doing so, this project runs a nearest neighbor analysis in BigQuery, through SQL to get the distances for the amenities nearest to one another. In doing so, this really helps understand the closeness of community-building amenities. A dataset is then created from this SQL that is used in CARTO. Carto further runs a cluster analysis to understand the distribution of community amenities across Philadelphia. To build a strong cloud computing project, Bigquery a large cloud-based infrastructure, provided the opportunity to efficiently store a large OpenStreetMaps dataset, with detailed geospatial information including many different amenities. I further used SQL within BigQuery to create queries and run them efficiently, especially within a big dataset that ran many iterations for nearest neighbor. This project was completed by Alyssa Felix-Arreola and used OpenStreetMapsData, looking at their feature points, amenities, and the geographical boundary of Philadelphia.
